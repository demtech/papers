----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper is an interesting, though quite simple, analysis of voting system.

There are a number of tangential details mentioned in passing about which the authors do not seem to have thought deeply.  For instance, in the abstract, you say that the purpose is to generate a set of test cases per electoral scheme once and for all.  But having done so, it is of course possible to design systems that will pass your test cases but still contain bugs (malicious or accidental).  So while there is still great value in your work, you have gone overboard on what it can and cannot do.  

Another area of shallowness is the statement in the conclusion that you have achieved full statement coverage.  Statement coverage is a poor indicator of quality, and moreover you provide something deeper than that -- some kind of functional coverage.  Another sentence in the conclusion uses the term "code coverage", where again, I think you are giving something more -- even though of course passing your tests does not guarantee that the system is correct!  You should first be clear in your own mind what you mean, then you should present a serious discussion of coverage rather than mentioning it for the first time in the conclusion.  

I recommend on tuning down the "political" tone of the authors, things like "This state -of-affairs cannot continue" in the abstract for example. In the seventh line of the  second page ("would simply be no quesation of using electronic voting") - sometimes  people are using automatic systems even when it increase the error-rate, postal service  for example.

At footnote 4 on page 2, you probably mean privacy instead of security aspects.

The combinatorial explanation, IMHO, is redundant - one can reffer to Appendix B and the  last two lines on page 5 are confusing.

Why haven't you used Q in the table at the bottom on page 7?

In the definition of (L) at the fourth line from the end of page 11 one should add a conjunction condition that sum of B is smaller than the sum of A.

You should explain abbreviations the first time you use them (to make if more reader  friendly for layman in the field:
* "IRV: on third line of section 1.2 (should be Instant Runoff Voting).
* "Z and B specification" on the second line of page 4
* "CLEAN" in the third line of the second paragraph of page 4 (I know that it appeared  in "Votail: PR-STV Ballot Counting Software for Irish Elections" which was published  at FoVeOOS 2010 (http://www.demtech.dk/chrome/site/papers/CochranKiniry10.pdf)) but it  is not clear there too what the real meaning is.
* "Alloy" in the fifth line of section 2 (add a link to http://alloy.mit.edu/community  for example).

Some typographical comments:
The author affiliations is numbered with the same numbering system of the footnotes -  this cause the first footnote to get the number 3 instead of 1.

At footnote 5 on age 2, there is an extra (double) space at "Dail  Eireann".
Missing ending point in footnote 6.

Third line above the figure in page 3 - I recommend replacing "their do" with "number of  votes for them does".

Candidates should not appear twice on the third line of section 2.1

Add vertical separation lines to the tables, to help the reader divide the title  correctly (see, for example, at the bottom of page 6).

Extra "'" at the end of line 19 of page 10.

----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper advocates modelling and systematic test generation for a
class of complex electoral schemes with transferable votes. It focuses
on functional correctness rather than security.

The resulting test suites are clearly useful. Their generation 
is also technically interesting, reasonably challenging, and 
carefully explained.

I was expecting more detailed results on the tests, for all variants
described in the appendix. Also, it is not entirely clear that the
test generation would scale up to large numbers of seats & candidates.

I miss a discussion of the other aspects of the software, such as its
I/O mechanisms and its confidentiality (as the software should
probably not leak any information besides the election results).

The testing of non-deterministic and random cases in the schemes also
deserve more discussion.

"let be T" should be "let T"

----------- REVIEW -----------
Summary:
Electronic voting systems have to provide accurate results for even the most complicated voting mechanisms like Proportional Representation by Single Transferable Vote (PR-STV). They therefore need to be rigorously tested before they can be used in real elections. The paper describes the process of using the Alloy model checker to create test cases for an electronic implementation of the PR-STV voting mechanism. The contributions are a case study describing the process of modeling the PR-STV voting mechanism in Alloy’s modeling language, the resulting model, the description of the test case generation technique, and the results of running the tests on an actual implementation of this voting mechanism. 


Judgment:
The paper is very readable and the results are interesting but I think the result section and related works should be fleshed out. The result section talks about the resulting test cases of the process which the authors should describe in more detail. It is unclear how many test cases were produced and how much time it took to produce them. Also I am not convinced that statement coverage is an adequate metric for the quality of the resulting test cases. The related works part doesn’t reference similar work for automated test generation but the authors mention that such work exists.
Overall I believe the paper is not quite ready for TACAS. Hence, I gave a score of -1.

Details:
Page 1:
“Most tally systems, for example, are tested by re-running all past elections and seeing if the new system gives the same answer as an older, perhaps erroneous, system did.” “Tally systems” is plural, “new system” is singular I believe you should keep it either in plural or singular.

Except for the related works part the introduction does not address the technical aspects enough and is mainly focused on the voting scheme.


Page 4:
“There is, of course, a large amount of work in the field of model checking and test generation, but not directly related to voting as a case study and therefore not referenced in this paper." I believe the authors should address work that is similar from a technical perspective but done in a different domain to make their contribution clearer. They mention that such work exists in Section 4 but don’t reference it.

“In a plurality voting scheme the maximum number of preferences is one, otherwise the maximum length of a ballot is the number of candidates in the election.” Should be “one. Otherwise, the”


Page 9:
“What follows is a fairly straightforward exercise of applying model finding to the problem of test case generation. While this idea, at its core, is not novel, the use of Alloy for such generation, particularly for critical systems such as election tally systems, is completely novel.” The authors should provide a citation to such previous work. Because it seems to be similar work with a different tool it would be good to reference it. It would also be good to add this to the related works part and discuss the similarities/differences between them.

“We must derive from an outcome O a vector of ballots B that guarantee…” Change guarantee to guarantees.


Page 12:
“We have used our methodology to test Votail, the aforementioned rigorously engineered tally system for Irish PR-STV” I believe some more information about the characteristics of system under test would be interesting, how many lines of code does it have, how many conditions…

“We have achieved full statement coverage…” I am not sure if statement coverage alone is an adequate metric for the quality of a test suite. Perhaps the authors could also provide results related to condition coverage.

“…with only seven candidates in a three seat election…” In my opinion the authors should describe the resulting test suite in more detail it is not quite clear to me what the actual test suite looks like.


Page 14:
“Single Winner Plurality Voting” and “Instant Runoff Voting” I feel that these two explanations should be in the paper to make the paper more self-contained.

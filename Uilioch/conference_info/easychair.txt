Abstract: Existing commercial and open source e-voting systems have
horrifically poor testing frameworks.  Most tally systems, for
example, are tested by re-running all past elections and seeing if the
new system gives the same answer as an older, perhaps erroneous,
system did. This amounts to a few dozen system tests and, typically,
little-to-no unit tests. These systems are used today in a dozen
countries to determine the outcome of national elections. This
state-of-affairs cannot continue.

In this work, the ballot counting process for one of the most complex
electoral schemes used in the world, Proportional Representation by
Single Transferable Vote (PR-STV), is mechanically formally
modeled. The purpose of such a formalization is to generate, using an
algorithm of our design, a complete set of non-isomorphic test cases
per electoral scheme, once and for all. Using such a system test
suite, any digital election technology (proprietary or open source)
can be rigorously evaluated for correctness. Doing so will vastly
improve the confidence experts have---and can only improve the level
of trust citizens have---in these digital elections systems.
